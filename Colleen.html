    <h2>Background</h2>
    <ul>
        <p>Quantum computing are mainly governed by Quantum mechanics principles, the theory were developed in 1920 by Erwin Schrodinger,
        Werner Heisenberg and others, enables us to understand a host of phenomena involving atoms, molecules, nuclei, and solids.
            The practical applications of quantum mechanics, including the scanning tunneling microscope and nanoscale device that maybe used in future quantum
        computers.

    <h2>Inside a quantum
        computer</h2>
    <details open><summary>Quantum computing fundamentals</summary>
        <p>All computing systems rely on a fundamental ability to store and manipulate information. Current computers manipulate individual bits, which store information as binary 0 and 1 states. Quantum computers leverage quantum mechanical phenomena to manipulate information. To do this, they rely on quantum bits, or qubits.  </details>
